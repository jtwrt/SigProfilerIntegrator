# SigProfilerIntegrator - Work in progress
Generate representative signatures from different extractions.

Similar signatures are identified by calculating their cosine-similarity.
A threshold is chosen, which must be reached to merge signatures.

So far, the code was tested with previous extractions from SBS96 and SBS1536 signatures.
